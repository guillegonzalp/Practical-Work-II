            <h2>How is Kanye West one of the most influential artists in our generation.</h2>
            <p>Despite having started his music career as a mere producer, Kanye West, an artist raised up in Chicago,<br>
                with a middle-class background, has managed to become one of the most well-known and relevant music<br>
                artists today. Kanye, who has been a music enthusiast since he was young, began his career in the early<br>
                2000's producing for Roc-A-Fella Records, even producing albums for major artists such as Jay-Z and<br>
                earning gold and platinum records at a very young age.<br><br>

                However, when he wanted to quit being a producer to focus on creating his own songs, no record label<br>
                wanted to support him, in fact, they didn't want him to flourish in order to keep him as a producer, as<br>
                West was not only experimenting with a more cinematic and layered sound that had not been heard before<br>
                in hip-hop, but he was doing it as a complete outsider to the industry.<br><br>

                Kanye West managed to completely change the way certain tools were used in the music world, such as autotune, sampling<br>
                or interpreting. West also used Hip-Hop as a way to denounce everything he didn't think was correct, such as the<br>
                generalized homophobia in urban music, the racism in the United States and in musical organizations like the Grammys or<br>
                the lack of a father figure in most African-American families. It also helped numerous artists flourish, such as Tyler<br>
                the Creator, Travis Scott, Kid Cudi, Childish Gambino, Chance the Rapper and Metro Booming among others. And he managed<br>
                to receive preising from artists as big as Michael Jackson, Elton John, Paul McCartney, Prince and Bruce Springsteen.
