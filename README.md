# Practical-Work-II - FCE

The website contains other web pages where you will find information about the work of creating the website, about me, including my cv; information about a topic to choose, which in my case has been "How is Kanye West one of the most influential artists in our generation." and about the university degree I am studying (Computer Engineering and Mathematical Engineering): In addition you will find access to the websites of my classmates and a form to contact me.

Tools Used: CSS3 HTML5

Problems found during the creation of the website: As it was my first time doing a task such as creating a website, everything seemed expensive and at the beginning I would not have imagined that the final result would have turned out as it did. The biggest problem I had when creating the website was the issue of putting the colors in such a way that everything was legible. Also, I found CSS much more expensive than HTML, which in the end was more repetitive and you could understand it much better.

Conclussions: This work has helped me to understand and improve my knowledge about css and html much better than giving only practical classes; to come across an error and have to understand and solve it by myself has made me understand the use of these tools in a better way than if I had only seen the theoretical part of the tools.
